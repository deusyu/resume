During my tenure, I have been involved in various aspects of the inbound logistics process, including supporting pre-shipment quality inspections for our worry-free service, intercepting express deliveries in our cloud warehouse, and monitoring delivery times to proactively prevent package delays. By providing solutions that empower our merchants, I have been able to enhance their supply chain and logistics performance and improve their overall fulfillment experience.}

                \item \en{Participated in the design and iteration of the inbound link of the cloud warehouse, which supports both ERP and non-ERP merchants in creating, printing replenishment orders, scheduling warehouse appointments, green channel appointment scheduling (subject to approval), capacity occupancy, and pre-inspection. We incubated the cloud warehouse inbound service, consolidated the industry logic (special appointment scheduling, expiration date、clear out rule verification, notify merchants of quality inspection results, etc.), decoupled the architecture code of the cloud warehouse industry and the inventory control platform, clarified responsibilities, and accelerated business iteration; implemented the strategy and factory pattern to support multiple rule verifications such as expiration date and returns, allowing for future scalability and extensibility. For the pre-shipment quality inspection project, multiple resources such as product photos, nameplate images, and PDF manuals need to be uploaded prior to warehousing. A universal mobile phone scanning and image uploading SDK was developed to support mobile scanning and uploading of images, which are then displayed on the PC side. This ensures the privacy and security of the uploaded images by limiting access to them and setting expiration times for the image links to prevent them from being used maliciously as image hosting sites. This SDK has been implemented in other areas of the supply chain, such as for the uploading of business licenses by cargo owners.}

I communicated and coordinated with downstream order fulfillment centers, logistics operations, and logistics work order domains for development and joint testing to ensure the smooth and risk-free launch of the project. Currently, the cloud warehouse intercepts x orders per day with an x success rate, resulting in x hours of reduced manpower. To handle the increasing volume of business and the need for multi-condition queries, we used MySQL and ES to store data. The system performs multi-condition joint queries by first querying ES, and then fetching and concatenating non-condition queries from MySQL. We used Faas to consume MySQL's binlog, concatenate data, and stream it to ES for synchronization.}

The monitoring orders require filling in data information and calling multiple RPC interfaces, and to reduce repeated requests, a memory cache is constructed to store the request results in the context. Timer is used to obtain cached data from MySQL and store it in memory to reduce frequent DB queries, especially for infrequently changing rule and event configurations.
